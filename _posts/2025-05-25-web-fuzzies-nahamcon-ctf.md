This challenge involved finding five hidden flags through a series of web-based exploits. Including endpoint fuzzing, login brute-forcing, and API enumeration. I managed to retrieve four out of five flags, uncovering most of the application’s logic and data exposure paths.

## First Part

by using the wordlist and FUZZing by using intruder, i find this endpoint: 

``
/api/users
``
but, when trying to access ``/{id}`` it gave that an error:

How to bypass? by adding ``/{id}/log``

After that, we can simply bruteforce to find the right id for it from ``1 - 100``


```
/api/users/0/log
/api/users/1/log
...
/api/users/100/log
```

### Flag #1

``flag{31ef61815ae2b7209d0493b996608be5}``

## Second Part

Log in as admin. From first flag we will get the admin details ``"username":"brian.1954"``
Then bruteforce the password with wordlist ``password.txt`` given

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ef0a15f6-5ec5-41eb-99e5-c1384a902f17)

```
username : brian.1954
password : dallas
```

### Flag #2

After that, simply log in with the given username and password. The flag will be in the admin dashboard

``flag{8a8b9661b3bd2baa2c74347a6c5cc0fc}``

## Third Part

For this flag, in the ``/admin/messages/`` each message has it own ``{id}``
So, again we use intruder to bruteforce this

```
/admin/messages/0
/admin/messages/1
...
/admin/messages/1000
```

### Flag #3

We are seeing an extra message id which then provide us with the third flag:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7249edc-17bf-4f80-bd28-eeae505596f5)
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/343cc492-0957-4f4e-aafe-5ddfeeefe87c)

``flag{3a5aed9baa7c7b3ba6cbe4a15425af3f}``

## Fourth Part

From Flag #3 question we are given with ``666e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440666``

How to use this? Upon reviewing api-endpoints for each request. I find that in /collection

![Screenshot 2025-05-26 022134 copy](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b5b93eab-b713-44ec-a576-57f22bfb4f05)

We had json files that are storing the data of the fuzzies bear with GET request on api-endpoint called ``/api/fuzzies``

```json

That's mean UUID we had before should be the id for fuzzies: 
```http://challenge.nahamcon.com:31526/api/fuzzies?id=666e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440666```

### Flag #4
