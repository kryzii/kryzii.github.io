This web challenge simulated a concert ticket-queue system protected by JSON Web Tokens (JWT). By intercepting requests in Burp Suite, manipulating the queue token, and exploiting an exposed JWT_SECRET value in an API error response, I was able to forge a valid token, skip the waiting line, and complete a purchase request to reveal the flag.

## Recon

## Solution 

For the exploitation part, we are required to intercept by using Burpsuite. 

After the POST **/join_queue** request, we will be response with the token that represent for our queue time.

First, we suppose to change the token (by using https://jwt.io/) to cut the queue time for buying the tickets from:

to:

Next, intercept the POST request to **/check_queue**, and change with our new token. 

After intercepting the **/check_queue** the response will give us an error that saying the *JWT_SECRET* for our jwt token is incorrect.

But, in the error it is actually included the correct *JWT_SECRET* which something that are not suppose to be expose:

```
"JWT_SECRET":"4A4Dmv4ciR477HsGXI19GgmYHp2so637XhMC"
```

So we can use the *JWT_SECRET* given and change our token with valid jwt secret and reintercept the request again with the working jwt token. 

Next, be sure to always change to our jwt token to each request such as **/purchase** and **/purchase?html=true**

## Flag

By then, we will be provided with pdf file with confirmation code as the flag/we can simply get those from the **/purchase?html=true** response
