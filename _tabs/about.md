Hello, I’m Lukman   
I used to do a lot of creative stuff - Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, but not so much anymore. 
But I’ve shifted gears into cybersecurity. I played multiple CTFs for fun and love red-teamy challenges. 
I’m into HTB and THM boxes, currently working on improving my source-code review. 
Planning to pursue CPTS, cause they say it’ll make my technical skills go crazy.
The cats on my profile? That’s Haku and Latte, my girlfriend’s fluffy duo.  

## CTFs

I haven't actually won anything just yet, cause yeah. Everyone so goated. The best I’ve reached so far was during:
- Sunway CTF (Open Category) @ C4lyr3x (w Akmal & Afiq)
- UM Cybersecurity Summit (UMCS) CTF Finals @ meowware (w Zeqzoq, Ajiqqos and Chong)
- N3XT_L3V3L CTF @ C4lyr3x (w Akmal & Afiq)
- Stout CTF (Solo) collaboration between UniKL (MIIT) & University of Wisconsin-Stout
- and a few other online CTFs — hopefully I’ll win something soon.
